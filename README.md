# notepad--
A(nother) text editor. Written in java for use with EVERYTHING! (The name is a play on words from the popular notepad++)

Also the plan is to have lots of different supported languages but as of now there are only txt, html, and java. It may seem trivial to ask for the file extesion instead of including it in the file name, but a later version will hopefully have an 'execute' or 'run' feature where you test whatever you have written.
